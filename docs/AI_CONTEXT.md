# LazyFrog DevTerm — AI Context

This document explains what LazyFrog DevTerm is and how it should be understood by tooling and assistants.

---

## What it is

LazyFrog DevTerm is a keyboard-first, PowerShell-based TUI application for Windows Terminal. It groups a few developer utilities into one fast, consistent interface so common tasks can be done without leaving the terminal.

It is **not** a general CLI framework or a background service. It is an interactive terminal UI that renders screens and responds to keystrokes.

## Core modules

1. **GitHub Scanner**
   - Searches public GitHub repositories.
   - Shows key repo details (stars, language, last update).
   - Saves results to JSON or Markdown for sharing or tracking.
   - Maintains a local watchlist.

2. **Task Runner**
   - Executes commands defined in tasks.json.
   - Organizes tasks by category.
   - Tracks execution history.
   - **Important:** Git tasks must be run inside a Git repository folder.

3. **System Monitor**
   - Displays live CPU/RAM usage.
   - Shows disk usage and top processes.
   - Provides quick system context without leaving the terminal.

4. **Help & Docs**
   - Built-in help screens for every module.
   - Keyboard shortcuts and navigation reminders.

## Why it exists

LazyFrog DevTerm is meant for developers who prefer to stay inside the terminal. It reduces context switching, keeps routine actions consistent, and outputs data in plain files that can be shared, reviewed, or versioned.
